## *Motivational Quote Chrome Extension* ##
This extension uses a free api with Motivational Quotes in JSON format.
My extension then picks a random quote using a random number generator to display a quote and its author.
If the author is null in JSON, it displayes the author as 'Anonymous'


I found CS50 quite chalengning, but extremely rewarding throughout it.
It took me longer than it should've at some points and I think it came down to my motivation (or lack thereof).
I designed this extension to (hopefully) make the course even more enjoyable and rewarding for future students of the course.
